 * notification bell via toDatabase(). Reusing that same array here means
 * every notification gets an email and a push notification for free, with
 * identical wording, instead of duplicating a toMail()/toFcm() in every
 * concrete class.
 *
 * ShouldQueue: dispatches to the `jobs` table (QUEUE_CONNECTION=database)
 * instead of sending inline within the request — required so a bulk
 * fan-out (see ActivityCreated/ActivityUpdated/ActivityMissed/Announcement,
 * which can each target hundreds of students from one admin action) can't
 * block that request on synchronous SMTP. Draining the queue is handled by
 * a scheduled `queue:work --stop-when-empty` in routes/console.php, piggybacking
 * on the same cron entry the scheduler already needs.
